Thereby, gamification can craft extrinsic motivators to internalize the intrinsically motivated behavior.

A field where gamification has not yet been (explicitly) applied systematically is voting behavior (i.e., governance participation). One notable exception is a large-scale experiment with 61 million users of facebook, where researchers found that an ",(0,n.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"I voted")," indication on their status page, could have been responsible for about 340'000 additional voters in the 2010 election (",(0,n.yg)("a",{parentName:"p",href:"https://www.nature.com/articles/nature11421"},"Bond et al., 2012")," and ",(0,n.yg)("a",{parentName:"p",href:"https://www.nature.com/news/facebook-experiment-boosts-us-voter-turnout-1.11401"},"this article"),"). The main driver here is considered to be peer-pressure elicited on facebook friends. While the researchers did not explicitly link this intervention with gamification, it could be perceived as such and might also work to incentivize participation of a small group. A similar application is the famous ",(0,n.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"I voted")," badge in US elections, which has proven to be successful (",(0,n.yg)("a",{parentName:"p",href:"https://www.usvotefoundation.org/voter-reward-badge"},"see"),"). Voters like to show off badge and motivate others to go as well (some shops even offer perks for customers having that badge)."),(0,n.yg)("p",null," A review on 91 scientific studies reveals that gamification provides overall positive effects in 71% of cases, 25% of cases no effect and only in 3% of studies were negative results reported (",(0,n.yg)("a",{parentName:"p",href:"https://trepo.tuni.fi/bitstream/handle/10024/104598/gamification_of_education_2018.pdf"},"Majuri et al., 2018"),"). such as increased engagement and enjoyment, while awcknowledging that the effectiveness is context-dependent. Despite the overwhelming majority of positive results, some studies indicate negative effects of gamification and suggest that there are some caveats.

Another reason for critique is the lack of clear theoretical foundation and the resulting diverse approach to the questions.

In later analyses it was found that there were plenty of evidence available, which had been willingful neglected by committee members. This problem is also related to the pressure to behave conform with authority figures, as illustrated by famous psychological experiments (e.g., ",(0,n.yg)("a",{parentName:"p",href:"https://www.demenzemedicinagenerale.net/pdf/MilgramOriginalWork.pdf"},"Milgram, 1963"),", ",(0,n.yg)("a",{parentName:"p",href:"https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1952-00803-001"},"Asch, 1961"),"). It is crucial to keep that in mind, to mitigate that problem by dividing the final decision between important stake-holders. However, knowing about this issue, we can implement mechanisms to further improve the outcome of the decision making. A study by ",(0,n.yg)("a",{parentName:"p",href:"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/104973239700700407"},"MacDougall & Baum (1997)"),' has shown that explicitly announcing a "devil\'s advocate" can improve the outcome by challenging the consensus frequently.'),(0,n.yg)("p",null,"Studies in behavioral economics further show that individual decision making is influenced by ",(0,n.yg)("em",{parentName:"p"},"loss-aversion"),".
