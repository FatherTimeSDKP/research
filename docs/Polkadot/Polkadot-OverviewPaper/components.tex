\section{Components and sub-protocols}\label{sec:components}
%\begin{samepage}
Next, we summarise Polkadot functionality shortly for an overall picture and then continue to describe the individual sub-protocols and components. %We conclude with a summary and description of what each sub-protoclol and components achieve in Section \ref{sec:summary}.

Polkadot's validators are selected by the NPoS scheme (Section~\ref{sec:validators}). Nominated Proof-of-Stake or NPoS is our adaptation of PoS where an unlimited amount of token holders can participate as nominators, backing with their stake a large but limited set of validators. This paradigm simultaneously achieves high levels of security and scalability, as well as an unprecedented level of decentralisation by ensuring a property known in voting theory as proportional justified representation \cite{sanchez2017proportional, brill2017phragmen}. Nominators, who are economically vested in the security of the system, act as watchdogs over the validators' performance. Based on the nominators' expressed preferences over candidates, every era the system selects a set of validators with stake backings that are as high and as evenly distributed as possible. Nominators are also economically disincentivized from concentrating their votes on too few validators, which helps keep the system decentralised over time. Furthermore, the election mechanism is highly adaptive to sudden changes, such as some validators being kicked out after a slashing, as it automatically redistributes the nominators' backings across the new set of validators, even when the votes themselves do not change.

The security goal of Polkadot is to be Byzantine fault tolerant when the participants are rational (see Section \ref{sec:economics} for more details on incentives and economics). We assume that with the properties NPoS gives, the stakeholders elect a set of validators that has a more than $2/3$ fraction of honest members.

The elected validators are responsible for running the relay chain (Section~\ref{sec:relaychain}). While each parachain's collators are responsible for generating parachain blocks (Section~\ref{sec:parachainblockproduction}), the validators are divided into rotating subsets, one for each parachain, and need to attest to the validity of parachain blocks before the headers of those blocks are included in the relay chain.

To achieve good scalability the number of validators in each of these subsets is small. Nonetheless, thanks to the NPoS guarantee that every validator is well backed, the availability and validity scheme (Section~\ref{sec:validity-and-availability}) can ensure that any attack on the validity of Polkadot is very expensive in expectation. In fact, the entirety of Polkadot's economic security backs every parachain. This is in stark contrast to having, say, 100 independent blockchains with an equivalent sum total of stake, where on average each blockchain is backed by 1/100-th of the stake, and thus only benefits from 1/100-th the level of security. We guarantee availability by using erasure coding of each parachain block to make the validators collectively and robustly responsible for the availability of these blocks without breaking scalability.

For this to work, we need to be able to revert the chain until we know with good probability that all parachains are correct. This means that we need to be able to reorganise the chain and for that the chain needs to be capable of forking. Thus we use a block production mechanism, BABE (Section~\ref{sec:babe}), that while run by validators, has similar properties to proof-of-work chains. Specifically, we can use the longest chain rule as part of our consensus, and the next block producer is not known in advance. On its own BABE would require us to wait a long time from the moment a block is produced to the moment it is finalised, i.e.~when we can be confident that with high probability the block will never be reverted. Slow finality is required in some circumstances to deal with challenges to availability. Most of the time, however, we would prefer to finalise blocks much faster.  For this purpose, validators finalise blocks using GRANDPA (Section~\ref{sec:consensus}), a finality gadget that is cleanly separated from block production. This separation makes it very adaptive and here allows us to delay finalising blocks until challenges are dealt with, without slowing down block production. GRANDPA gets Byzantine agreement on finalised blocks and will allow us to prove to an entity that keeps track of the validator set which blocks are finalised, which will be important for bridges (Appendix~\ref{sec:bridge}).

If an account on one parachain sends tokens to another parachain, then XCMP (Section~\ref{sec:XCMP}) ensures that this message is delivered correctly. It is sent at a speed which is not dependent on how long it takes to finalise blocks, which means that it needs to deal with the possibility of Polkadot forking. Thus we optimistically execute based on the assumption that the parachain blocks are correct. If one is not, then we need to revert and for that, it is important that parachains only receive messages that were sent by blocks recorded on this new relay chain fork, and not the reverted fork. Thus we need that  the parachain and XCMP logic ensure that a fork of the relay chain defines a consistent history of Polkadot and thus messages only arrive when they have been sent previously in the history defined by this fork. 

If the token transfer is carried out in conjunction with SPREE modules (Appendix~\ref{sec:SPREE}) then that ensures that so long as the parachains execute correctly, tokens can only be created and destroyed in an agreed upon way. In turn the correct execution of the chains code is guaranteed by the availability and validity scheme. SPREE ensures that shared code needed for the token transfer logic is correct as well. Even though chains can change their own code, they will not be able to change the code of SPREE modules. Instead the code of SPREE modules is stored centrally and the execution of that code and its storage will be sandboxed from the rest of the state transition. This ensures that this token transfer message is interpreted correctly and obtains the guarantees about tokens we want. %}{After this point everything is too abstract for me and I could not get the execution logic of XCMP. I do not know much about XCMP so I believe most readers may feel the same as me}

On the side of economics (Section~\ref{sec:economics}), we aim to have a controlled near-constant yearly inflation rate. As stated before, it is important for the security of the system that all validators have large amounts of stake backing them. Our adaptive reward schedule for validators and the nominators backing them ensures that overall participation in NPoS stays high, and that the validators' stake backings are evenly distributed. On a more granular level, we pay or slash validators on a per-executed-action basis, and extend the same rewards or punishment onto nominators proportionally, to ensure that the rational strategy is compatible with honest behaviour.

The relay chain's logic itself will need updating occasionally. The governance mechanism (Section~\ref{sec:governance}) allows Polkadot token holders to participate in the decision-making process rather than having any changes to the system be imposed by a central authority -- or in the case of some decentralised systems, by a team of developers. Too often, a contentious code change has led existing blockchains to an impasse or a permanent fork. 
We want a mechanism that balances being able to make uncontentious changes quickly when needed, while also providing the tools to deal with contentious proposals in a decisive and fair manner. The ultimate arbiters of Polkadot are the Dot token holders and so all important decisions, such as code changes, are made by state-weighted referenda. There is an elected council, responsible for making smaller decisions and partially setting the priority for referenda, in such a way that they cannot block a change that a majority wants.

Lastly we review 
some of the primitives that Polkadot sub-protocols are using such as the cryptographic keys and networking scheme in Section \ref{sec:crypto} and Section \ref{sec:networking}, respectively. Polkadot's networking needs to extend the peer-to-peer gossip network that is standard in single chain permissionless blockchains to a multi-chain system, where any nodes network traffic should not scale with the total data of the system.%Sell these!






%Polkadot consists of a main chain called the relay chain and multiple sharded chains called parachains.
 %that are also responsible for producing the relay chain blocks \ref{sec:babe} and keeping the state of all the parachains \ref{sec:relaychain}.
%Validators need to vote on the consensus over all the parachains, see the consensus scheme \ref{sec:grandpa} for more details.

%Collators and fishermen that are responsible for parachain block production  and reporting invalid parachain blocks respectively.
%The parachain validators assigned to each parachain validate each parachain block and are responsible to keep it available, see \ref{sec:validity-and-availability}. Moreover, another feature of Polkadot is enabling interchain messaging among parachains, see \ref{sec:XCMP} for more details.
%Furthermore, Polkadot has a decentralised governance scheme \ref{sec:governance} that can change any Polkadot design decisions and parameterisation.

\section{Future Work}\label{sec:futurework}
For future work we plan to focus on a number of extensions for Polkadot.
%In this section we summarise Polkadot's components and describe what they aim to achieve.
We want to add an incentivisation model for fishermen to make sure they are incentivised to report malicious behaviour. 
To enable trustless messaging we are working on SPREE \ref{sec:SPREE}. We are also interested to increase scalability of Polkadot further, for example by investigating the idea of having nested relay chains. Moreover, we are working on incorporating bridging protocols \ref{sec:bridge} to other chains  such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Zcash. Furthermore, to increase usability we are planning to enable \emph{Parathreads}, which have the same utility as parachains but are temporary and have a different fee model.
