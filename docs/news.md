We have open sourced and published an [improvement to our BLS signature aggregation](https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/1611) which allows for more efficient signature verification. We have submitted this work to [Financial Cryptography 2023](https://fc23.ifca.ai/).

**01.08.22**  
We have open sourced a [fully succinct BLS signature aggregation achieved using custom SNARKs](https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/1205). This allows one to define and construct accountable light client systems that, in turn, are the core cryptographic primitive used for building bridges between PoS blockchains. See [the project page](https://github.com/w3f/apk-proofs) for full details.

**02.12.21**:
