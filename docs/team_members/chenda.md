# Chen-Da Liu-Zhang

chenda@web3.foundation

Chen-Da has joined the Web3 Foundation team in July 2023 as a research scientist. His area of expertise encompasses both Cryptography and Distributed Systems, with a broad focus on the theory and practice of multi-party computation, consensus, peer-to-peer network, data availability, provable composable security and many others. His research has led to more than 25 publications at top international venues.

**Short Bio.** Prior to joining W3F, Chen-Da spent two years as a Post Doctoral Fellow in the Computer Science Department at Carnegie Mellon University (Pennsylvania) and in the Cryptography and Information Security (CIS) Laboratory at NTT Research (California). Chen-Da completed his Ph.D. in the Cryptography and Information Security group at ETH Zurich. Before that, he obtained a master's degree in computer science from ETH Zurich, and two bachelor degrees in computer science and mathematics from Universidad Autónoma Madrid.
